I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dck in his hands, alright? Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.
<br>
I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. When they come... they come at what you love.
<br>
Never let anyone know what you are thinking. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.
<br>
You can act like a man! Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.
<br>
What's wrong with being a lawyer? Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born?
<br>
I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English.
<br>
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor.
<br>
Te salut, Don Corleone. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. Friends and money - oil and water. It's not personal. It's business.
