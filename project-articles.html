  <h2>TEMPLATE - Suspension System Modeling</h2>

  <p class="intro">
    A quarter-car suspension model developed in Simulink to
    study ride comfort and road handling.
  </p>

  <p>
    The system consists of two coupled differential equations
    representing the sprung and unsprung masses. Parameters
    were tuned to analyze overshoot and settling time.

  <p>
    Results show the expected trade-off between passenger comfort
    and tire-road contact stability.
