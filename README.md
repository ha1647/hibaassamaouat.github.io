Personal website of Hiba Assamaouat </br>

:warning: Work in Progress :construction:


## Tasks & Timeline

This is the first phase of this website. Twice before, I have tried to develop it, but have failed to complete it because I was building up on a fragile base, and more ideas kept emerging, which caused me to stack blocks on a tower that was bound to fall. This repository is a new version, rebuilt from scratch.<br>
I would like to specify that no template was used here. I code everything up myself, along with some help from the internet of course. I have nothing against using templates, I simply made the choice to take this project as a web dev challenge.<br>

  - [X] New repository set up <br>
  - [X] Set the deadlines for MVP <br>
  - [ ] Redefine the look and feel of the page (probably not switching to a one-pager, I want the freedom to add new tabs) <br>
---
`15-12-2025` <br>
  - [ ] Reevaluate the importance of each page and what should be kept <br>
  - [ ] Set up styles.css <br>
  - [ ] Have 0-index.html up and running <br>
  - 

Initial tabs are: `Home`, `Experience`, `Projects`, `Coursework`, and `Blog`. <br>
Updated configuration and contents:<br>

  >`Home` Brief introduction of who I am and what I currently do. This page should be enough for a recruiter (or anyone) to learn everything about me. CV should be accessible from here, as well as my social pages. The rest of the tabs serve as an experience for the visitor and allows them to dive deeper into my story.

  >`Experience` Here the visitor gets a story of my career, they can access my cv, my portfolio, they can read my journey to and through NYUAD (`Coursework` tab gets integrated here)

  >`Projects` This one compiles all the academic and non academic projects, portfolio will also be accessible through here.

  >`Blog` For the time being, this page will be kept as a "coming soon".

## About the management of this repository

I am the sole author of this public repository and claim all this work to be mine. I invite any new coder to learn from my code to implement their own, I tried to make it as clear and simple for all.

I format the commits as such `daydatemonthhourminute`, to keep track of all the changes on GitHub and GitHub Desktop. For example the next commit I am doing will be: `mon15dec1354`
