## Tasks & Timeline
`14-12-2025` <br>
  - [X] New repository set up <br>
  - [X] Set the deadlines for MVP <br>
  - [ ] Redefine the look and feel of the page (probably not switching to a one-pager, I want the freedom to add new tabs) <br>
  - [ ] Reevaluate the importance of each page and if it should be kept <br>

`15-12-2025` <br>
  - [ ] Set up styles.css <br>
  - [ ] Have 0-index.html up and running <br>

Initial tabs are: `Home`, `Experience`, `Projects`, `Coursework`, and `Blog`. <br>
Updated configuration and contents:<br>

  >`Home` Brief introduction of who I am and what I currently do. This page should be enough for a recruiter (or anyone) to learn everything about me. CV should be accessible from here, as well as my social pages. The rest of the tabs serve as an experience for the visitor and allows them to dive deeper into my story.

  >`Experience` Here the visitor gets a story of my career
