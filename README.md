Personal website of Hiba Assamaouat </br>

:warning: Work in Progress :construction:


## Tasks & Timeline

This is the first phase of this website. Twice before, I have tried to develop it, but have failed to complete it because I was building up on a fragile base, and more ideas kept emerging, which caused me to stack blocks on a tower that was bound to fall. This repository is a new version, rebuilt from scratch.<br>
I would like to specify that no template was used here. I code everything up myself, along with some help from the internet of course. I have nothing against using templates, I simply made the choice to take this project as a web dev challenge.<br>

  - [X] New repository set up <br>

`15-12-2025` <br>
  - [X] Reevaluate the importance of each page and what should be kept <br>
  - [ ] Redefine the look and feel of the page (probably not switching to a one-pager, I want the freedom to add new tabs) <br>
  - [ ] Set up styles.css <br>
  - [ ] Have 0-index.html up and running <br>
  - [ ] 404 not found page <br>

Initial tabs are: `Home`, `Experience`, `Projects`, `Coursework`, and `Blog`. <br>
Updated configuration and contents:<br>

  >`Home` Brief introduction of who I am and what I currently do. This page should be enough for a recruiter (or anyone) to learn everything about me. CV should be accessible from here, as well as my social pages. The rest of the tabs serve as an experience for the visitor and allows them to dive deeper into my story.

  >`Experience` Here the visitor gets a story of my career, they can access my cv, my portfolio, they can read my journey to and through NYUAD (`Coursework` tab gets integrated here), then my internship and research experiences, and finally, they can find out what I am currently up to.

  >`Projects` This one compiles all the academic and non academic projects, engineering, design, art projects. Portfolio will also be accessible through here. In each project, I need to explain the tools used, my contributions, lessons learnt.

  >`Blog` For the time being, this page will be kept as a "coming soon".

The look and feel of the page are first visualized on a design app. Could be Figma, Powerpoint, Keynote, etc. I use Freeform. Using my initial design along with my peers' personal websites, I put together and edit the first using the fonts and palette until I reach the configuration I am satisfied with. My goal is to keep things minimal and, as described in the `Home` tab description, to make it able to stand alone, with all the necessary information for a recruiter without needing to search for the fundamental things about me elsewhere.

The palette was not changed from the previous version of the website:

## About the management of this repository

I am the sole author of this public repository and claim all this work to be mine. I invite any new coder to use my code as a reference but to implement their own, I tried to make it as clear and simple as possible for all.

I format the commits as such `daydatemonthhourminute`, to keep track of all the changes on GitHub and GitHub Desktop. For example the next commit I am doing will be: `mon15dec1354`.
